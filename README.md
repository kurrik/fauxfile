Fauxfile
========
A wrapper around the os package functions which deal with files and filesystems.

The intention of this package is to provide real and mock implementations of
a filesystem interface, so that unit testing file functionality is simplified.

Current Status
--------------
Starting to get to a place where it could be used, major filesystem operations
exist, need to work on File I/O.
